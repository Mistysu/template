			<p style="color: black">It must be pale and unreadable if I just talk what is the martial art. 
			   So here is the example: the movie. 
			   I believe movie is the best tool to help speeches to purchase and explain what they want. 
			   Actually, I am a typical Chinese girl. 
			   At the time I see numerous American action movies in the cinema with my friends, such as the Man on the steel, Fast and Furious, Pacific Rim, and the transformers, I will exactly think about movies in China. Not only are they different from the color of American movie, the most interesting thing is that the meaning of these movies is totally different, in other way, weird. </p>
			 <p></p>
             <P style="color: black">The movie I would like to discuss about is called the 14 Blades, which is also an action movie while Donnie Yen and Vicki Zhao are the protagonists. 
			    The movie is about destiny, love and responsibility. 
				There are four blades and every one of them represents one kind of Chinese mythical creatures: the cyan dragon, the God in the East worshipped by the Taoists, the white tiger, the God in the West worshipped by the Taoists, the rose finch, the God in the South worshipped by the Taoists, and the tortoise, the God in the North worshipped by the Taoists. 
				Fatuous and incapable, the emperor destroys the whole country and then the dragon man save the country by devoting his life. 
				He first took the imperial seal that was stolen by the other three guardians to the neighborhood country and then met a beautiful but also had a high skilled martial art girl. 
				They used their martial art by sword or bullwhip to protect themselves, to attack with baddie, and to preserve and make sure to give the imperial seal to the hand of a good emperor. 
				Also, this is the only way to solve their country. Actually, this is an easy understanding but indeed an extremely long story that owns giant martial art performance and specific body movement and gesture such as flying in the sky, running on the water surface, fighting each other on the trees, etc. 
				There are just things that you cannot imagine. These are Chinese martial arts.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p style="color: black">Martial art is the main and vital culture that I want to talk about from the 14 Blades. 
			   Chinese people can never be failed fascinated in something strange and incredible. 
			   This is the nature.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p style="color: black">And for my own, I used to learn taekwondo, one of the most famous kinetic activities all over the world. 
			   To tell the truth, it is very tired to learn it and sometimes it is easy to get hurt because of unconsciousness. 
			   I studied it for around a year and of course I become healthier or other ways… 
			   I think I become a little bit stronger… 
			   But after deciding to do some Kong Fu, I did it for a week and I found that my spirit can be more concentrated than I used to be and I felt easier and more comfortable. 
			   Also, I noticed that my mood was not so easy get annoyed than before. 
			   I learned to calm down and smell the fresh air, to think how nice the sky is and how to love my life. 
			   It is a worth to do that, I found. </p>
