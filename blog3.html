			<h1 style="font-family: impact; color: violet">Advertisements and their Effectiveness</h1>
			<p style="color: black">The advertisement: imported from Detroit is about Chrysler Cars that are made from Detroit. By watching the short 2 minutes advertisement, the first thing appearing in front of our eyes are the scenery and imaginary of Detroit, the factory city, with the voiceover to describe the landscape and the circumstance of this factory city. We can see lots of factories and their chimneys in the advertisement, which emphasize that Detroit is a city with highly developing industries. And there is a jingle from the voiceover: the hardest fire makes the hardest steel, which also wants to convey a message to audience: the steel in Detroit is the best and the hardest all over the America. These are followed by a car coming out to our eyesight, with the driver drive it around the city and showed how relax he felt. He felt lose himself when he driving his car with his word: this is not New York, this is Detroit to rise up how wonderful this car that is imported from Detroit is to let audience to consider they want to buy the Chrysler cars.</p>
