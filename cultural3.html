			<h1 style="font-family: Garamond; color: yellow">Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p style="color: black">Looking through the long history of China, there are a lot of unbelievable stories, myths, and legendaries. 
			   Chinese people has an effect called nostalgic complex, that is whenever you go whatever you want you will always think about the substitutes in China. </p>
			<p></p>
            <p style="color: black"><strong>Martial art</strong>, what I want to discuss about, is, actually in one kind of stratification, like a kind of spiritual sustenance that represent Chinese people’s feelings and lovings of Kong Fu. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p style="color: black">From the history, we all know that in primitive society people were struggling with monsters and beats with sticks and rope, 
			   which was known as the origin of marginal art. 
			   And with time goes by, after one dynasty to the other, the marginal art was becoming more and more perfect and incredible, from bronze to iron, from polearms like stick to sword… 
			   Then, after several years, people became like competing and performing with some skills using marginal arts such as knives and swords dancing, which is turned to be imagined by many authors like Jing Yong and Liang Yusheng to write books with suppose if people can fly can fighting in the sky. 
			   And this kind of imagination is widely used in numerous films and novels, which mean it becomes a kind of idealistic type. What’s more, this causes a group of people to do this. 
			   They are addicted by the marginal arts and they are crazy learning it in order to walk on the water surface and fly in the sky. 
			   Even more, some people setup his or her own martial skill in different mountain, which evolves into one of the most interesting cultures in China. 
			   For example, in Wudang Mountain, there is a martial called Wudang Sect that are good at swords; in Emei Mountain, there is a martial called Emei Sect that are good at Palm method. 
			   These dedicate a powerful and mystery phenomenon in China. 
			   The other type of the martial art, which is more realistic, has some patterns of manifestation, and I believe some of you have heard that before: Kong Fu and Tai Ji. 
			   These two are truly Chinese culture and kept for a very long history.</p>
			<p></p>
            <p style="color: black">According to what I said forward, there still must be numerous people who are confused about why Chinese people do martial art and so addicted to the thing that is meaningless. 
			   Actually, I was confusing also when I was a high school student. 
			   I went to the library so as to check for the answer and also I get more used to what is the modern martial art now: Tai Ji, or Kong Fu. 
			   In the light of the changing and processing from history, Tai Ji becomes the widest and the most accessible martial art by general public. 
			   And I always saw countless olds to do Tai Ji in groups together on the square, beside the road and even at home. 
			   Why? This is about another original about Tai Ji in China. 
			   Long long ago, Confucius, one of the most vital philosophers in Chinese history, wrote a book named Yi Zhuan, which inside said that Yi owns two images, which cause two forms. 
			   Two forms turn to four image and the latter birth eight diagrams. 
			   It is really hard to explain in English, but the core meaning is that Tai Ji is the beginning of all things. 
			   Then, people started to discover what the shape of Tai Ji is and opinions vary from one to the other. 
			   Somebody said it is the first gas at the time the universe took form, and the other one said Tai Ji is a virtual pattern that does not exist, even there were some people said Tai Ji is composed by Ying and Yang. 
			   Indeed, the third hypothetical theory is the origin of the martial art Tai Ji. 
			   And I think this is a kind of artifact that contributes to those olds who are exercising in the morning and at night. 
			   They want themselves be healthy and comfortable, and also, have a good self-cultivation. 
			   This is also the reason why Tai Ji can be of so long standing in Chinese history.<p> 
			<p></p>
            <p style="color: black">Either Kong Fu or Tai Ji is a good and famous exercise doing that can benefit olds and young in the morning all around China. 
			   It is a perfect way to do these together with some slow music for in the light of the science Kong Fu is conductive to hemokinesis. 
			   So every day when I go to school, I can always see a lot of people playing Tai Ji and Kong Fu in groups, many of them are olds but unbelievably they look so young that you can never consider they are more than 60. 
			   This phenomenon catches my interest of Chinese Kong Fu and some others.</p>
