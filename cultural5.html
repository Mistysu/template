			<h1 style="font-family: Garamond; color: yellow">Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p style="color: black">Although Kong Fu and Tai Ji are famous, I would like to say that there still have some problems and some initial questions about Kong Fu and Tai Ji. 
			   I am so glad that this culture can be kept and preserved so well from the antediluvian to current people. 
			   But this does not mean there will be no hidden danger for there is not have even one rule for protect and spread this culture. 
			   These years more and more Chinese children are becoming weird. 
			   They purchase luxury things from very young age also they bully because they think they have a large amount of money and they are highness. 
			   They despise Chinese traditional culture and they will never do this, what’s worse, sometimes they do not allow others to do what they dislike. 
			   This is a big problem in present China. 
			   And I am afraid; I am thinking what should we do if our country’s future is all such kind of people? 
			   I hope one day there will have a rule or law that protect our Chinese culture, for this is one thing that can help Chinese be more special and strong. </p>
