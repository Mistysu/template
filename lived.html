			<p>You can never know what you want to be as far as you go passed through one thing. Also, it is best to be the stronger.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>My major is finance, which I think is the best major for me. 
			   But what influence me to choose this major is a little bit long and I hope you can hear my story with deep patient.</p>
			<p></p>
            <p>When I was young, living with my grandparents was the most pleasant thing for me. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>I was born in Jiujiang, a beautiful city in Jiangxi Province, China. 
			   Jiujiang is not as big as Beijing or Shanghai. Actually, it is just like East Lansing, queit, warm and love. 
			   Unfortunately, I don’t really remember the definite scenery of Jiujiang until 2000, because I had a five-years-stay with my grandparents. </p>
			<p></p>
            <p>What technology most important and impact was the abacus that my granny gave me at my age of 3. 
			   My grandparents’ home is located in the countryside of the city, which owned neither tall departments nor numerous cars, 
			   with just some friendly old people, charming lake and vast grasslands. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Because of many reasons, there were not so many toys for me to play when I was young. 
			   Indeed, things I do the most were playing with my friends. 
			   Also, I was not a love-studying-math girl until one day my grandfather found the abacus he used before and gave it to me. 
			   Delicate, amazing, beauty of symmetry, these were not the only words to express abacus. 
			   I still kept in mind that the color of it was brown wood and the color of beads on the abacus were black wood, which seemed like old enough but as pretty as usual. 
			   I was so happy and love it at the time my grandpa gave it to me that I took it everywhere that I can imagine. </p>
			<p></p>
            <p>From the abacus, I learned a lot about counting, arithmetic, etc. 
			   And from that, I was fall in love with mathematics, which became a good start for me to choose finance as my major.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>After three years passed, I was 6 years old, which means I can go to primary school so far. 
			   And my parents bring me back to the downtown city. Not only was I crying for leaving but I was afraid of prosperous, loud and noisy city as well. I still remembered the first time I went to school, I was running out of the campus and standing in the middle of the road as soon as my mother was leaving, which cause a large traffic jam. My mother was annoyed and spanked me and I was crying again, after all. But after class, she picked me up and showed me one thing: the calculator. I would never forget my mom’s words, she said:” there are a large amount of people who cannot go to school; there are uncounted people who are dead because of starvation; there are numerous children who are homeless. You should cherish your time and opportunity and try your best to feel your life, to be confident. Do not be afraid for there is no afraid in the world. You should not be the weaker.” Actually I did not understand the meaning of the words, but I know this was a kind of so important thing that I should keep in mind. 
			   To be the truth, at that time I was more interested in the calculator than my mom’s words.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>But that is a piece of technology. The abacus and the calculator made me fall in love with math, which is the first step for me to choose finance to be my major. 
			   But why do not I choose math as my major? 
			   That is because the words of what my mother said and events I met as the time goes by and I was growing up. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>I always considered that Jiujiang is a lovely and peaceful city, which indicates that every person in this city will live happily without any annoyance. 
			   But I was definitely wrong with that. That was a cold winter dusk when I met the monkey and his host. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>“Mom…It is really cold outside,” I was talking to my mom to ask whether we can go home by taxi.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>‘’Yes, It is cold. But don’t you think it is a kind of exercise to walk in such a bad weather? ” My mother said that and pushed the door from the mall.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>I had to catch her with making faces. The wind was strong and bit with a sharper edge and I had to make my clothes tighten. 
			   My hair was flowing up and my hands shaped in fists. We walked a long way in silence, which was broken up by a situation that I would never forget.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>In front of my mother and I, there came a person with a monkey. They caught all my eyesight not because of their dressing in rags but because their face expressions. The man’s eyes were lose their fire, which were blank, empty and lackluster. I could not see the monkey, but I can feel the aura beside the monkey, loyalty but sadness. It feels like a flood flowing through the field and numerous lives were drowned. I cannot see the glory of the starry sky because of this. 
			   They looked at me for a while, and then just went passed across my side. I did not know why but I want to go to catch them and ask them if you want some bread.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>My mother saw my motion and pulled me:” Hey girl you feel sad, right?” I just nodded my head. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>“You ought not to be so sad. In this world, there is a saying from Darwin said, 
			   ‘survival of the fittest.’ That is why I told you not be the weaker. If you are strong enough, you can help others.”</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>I just felt encouraged. After so many years I finally found that those words from my mom really encouraged me. 
			   These words first sounds like injured and cruel but after thinking I recognized that it just look like telling me what I want and must to be. 
			   What is the exactly dream of my own.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>After these experiences and words from my not very long lives, 
			   I find my terminal station: earn money as much as I can and then to help improve other people’s lives, 
			   which is built from my interest of math and my experience from my childhood:I saw a lot of unfortunate things both one human and animals; 
			   I can never forget the rainy night that a monkey and its host stay together to keep warm; 
			   I can never slip the expression in beggars’ eyes from my memory. 
			   Then I think the best opportunity major for me is the finance. 
			   From that I can not only study a lot of knowledge but I can know the market quotation, 
			   also it is a good way to communicate from country to country for finance is the currency circulation, the talking bridge all over the world.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>What I want to tell at last, to be truth, is that, money is not everything but without money you can do nothing.(Das Kapital, Karl Marx ).</p>
