			<p style="color: black">As we all know, humans’ intelligence can never fail to fascinate scientist. For as we growing older and older, we are required to go to primary school, middle school, high school and college to fulfill our knowledge and exploit our brain. What I would like to talk about in this essay, anyway, is a kind of very different but highly efficient developing writing class in Michigan State University: WRA110, the Science and Technology, which is indeed relative and useful in our daily lives.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p style="color: black">Among the all 100 level courses, I would like to say there will no more class are like our 110 class in the writing class history among MSU. The first thing I want to introduce is the simple requirement and assignment in this class. Our 110 class is divided into four part of the assignment. The lived experience project is a piece of 1200 words in length project asked us to create a narrative detailing how a specific piece of technology has impacted our choice of a major/career at the present time; the culture analysis proposal is a paper with 1800-2100 words in length while using MLA or APA format to ask us, through the analysis of a cultural artifact, to investigate a specific social issue and its import on society; the third one is Formal Research Report, which is required us to give students who are new to the academic discipline/field we have chosen an introduction to the expectations for writing, reading, and researching in that discipline meanwhile the paper should help our audience understand the ways that literacies (both technological and rhetorical) are used to create and communicate knowledge in the discipline/field we choose to explore; the last but the most interesting one is Multimedia Remix Project. Multimedia Remix Project is a group working project that is divided into 2 parts. One is to write an individual memo of this project for Multimedia is asking us to make a video or documentary based on the previous three projects, and the other is a group working to make a documentary together. Also, there is one more project, the Course Retrospective. <p>

            <p style="color: black">But what I said above are just common content in this course. There must be someone curious about why we choose to stay in WRA110 class. To tell the truth, we learned a lot in this semester by studying in this curriculum. First of all, I know how to learn and write. As we beginning to establish or put something into active, we should do an imaginary outline and to modify it time after time. Otherwise, without outline we cannot do a well structure paper. The second thing I would like to show is that I learned how to make progress and critic by viewing peers’ paper from this class. For in class time to submit our assignment, we are required to upload files in Eli Review Website or Desire 2 Learn MSU website, and we will automatically divided in to a 3 person group to do team work, to look others’ papers and give them comment and evaluate the score, which I think is a nice way to progress ourselves. Also, the most important learning for me, from this course, is how to find useful materials that can make my essay more valuable. We have an in class activity called: the Library Activity, which asks us to go to the ProQuest database through the MSU Libraries’ Electronic Resources page to Choose two articles: one from the “Scholarly Journals” category and one from the “Magazines” category to do a search for a current topic, for example: global warming, war on terror, illegal immigration, etc. From which, helping me to find sources when I am writing Formal Research paper with APA or MLA formatting specifications. What’s more, this class gives me a chance to be a journalist because Multimedia project demand us to interview some professional people and add these interviewing fragments to our documentary. The last one I would like to mention is the peculiarity in this class: the Github. Our professor asks us to set up our own html website and put our essay on our own github, which is a huge challenge to me because I am too confused to computer programming. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p style="color: black">So, how I change and what I absorb from this class is clearly based on what I have mentioned above. I change my way of searching materials. Be honestly, I used to searching materials from books and Google and Baidu most frequently but never thinking about finding useful materials from the school electronic library websites or interviewing neither professional field people nor publics. Whatever, because of my former schools lacking such highly efficient technology, I think it is more likely for me that I absorb and learn how to find materials better than change. And, I have changed some habits of writing. I believe there must have some people who do not like to write outline before writing and lots of them, like me, also get high grades on the writing test. But what I want to emphasize is this is not appropriate when you come into college. In college, we are always required to write an essay more than thousands of words no matter what type of this, and the most difficult question for those who do not like to build an outline before writing is that their essay would seem like out of order and not clearly, which is just like a book without catalogue and title and you cannot understand what the author want to transmit for, so I changed my habit from never writing outline to do it in a high efficiency, and this also helped me to do a better and easier work in both the 100-writing level class and other classes when I am asked to write an essay. Gradually, I receive a lot of knowledge in the class and really appreciate the teaching style. For I have a higher knowledge level of some knowledge and term about writing, for instance: some formatting like MLA, some style like time sequence, some rhetorical device like metaphor, etc, and I have a higher writing awareness after writing 4 essays during the semester: writing is not just an assignment, but a emotion conduction and a way to express your position. Also, writing is your best friend for you can tell anything to him without leaking; it is our most honest and loyalty friend. </p>

            <p style="color: black">What I want to say at last, maybe your will hear from other people how hard or how deep challenge this class is comparing to other 100 level classes, I would like to suggest you to come to this class and have a look and consider if you would like to study it. Just like me, as the first time to study in the class room, I was shocked and annoyed myself because I cannot even understand a word from my professor! Maybe there will be some reason that I am a non English speaker but I am still very distressed and do not know what I should do. Because I have to study 100 level class during my college year whenever and I do not want to change class so I choose to stay here and listened trying my best. Fortunately, I get used to this situation after several time and I find such fun from the class for it is so relax and we can talk what we like freely and professor always tries her best to reach our request. I find I really enjoy in the time spending in this class and I really appreciate the class arrangement and atmosphere. So here is my suggestion to the future guy if you want to come to study here: do not be lazy, do not be annoyed if you do not do so well and do not complain about everything if you are an non English speaker, just let nature take this course and try your best to figure out everything and use your eyes to find and your heart to treat assignment carefully and talk to professor if you feel confuse or need some help, in which way I believe you will do a great process in the WRA110, the Science and Technology class in Michigan State University and you will love here. </p>

			<p style="color: black">Everything is this world is like this. If you give up one thing at the halfway of doing this, you must feel regret in the future when you look others reach successful. Sometimes do or not do is just a mind but what it will change is your whole life. At the time when you meet troubles, just keep in pace and absorb from failure meanwhile change your unsuitable habits, you will find that the bright future is just in front of your eyesight. The sun is heating the ground and you will find how wonderful a day is. </p>

			<p style="color: black">I am smiling now because I think of the past time when I am writing essays in pulling a long face. I am on my way to become a perfect person, this is just the start. </p>
