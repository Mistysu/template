			<h1 style="font-family: Garamond; color: green">Formal research report: Consider water and environment with economic influence</h1>
			<p style="color: black">Everything in this world has an ecosystem balance. 
			   That is called environment. Expectedly, with time flying and the improvement of the technology, our life becomes more comfortable and convenient. 
			   Human being is the most intelligent animal in the world, which is beyond doubtful. 
			   But people do not care about environment at first so they just vandalize the environment. 
			   In this case we lose countless things. 
			   The circumstance is becoming harder and harder with numerous serious questions come out without any phenomenon, such as global warming, earthquake, tsunami. 
			   How can these be more and more serious? Who plays the protagonist in this chain reaction? 
			   Actually, it is the water. Water exists everywhere; it is in the sky like vapor; it is in the cloud like crystal; it exists above the land; it has the shape of solid like ice; it has the shape of liquid like ocean; it has the shape of gas like evaporation. 
			   So I would like to talk about the water and the environment and the economic influence, as a biochemistry and finance student, in this formal research with my knowledge learning form the ISP-water and environment class and EC202 macroeconomic class with two particles in order to alert people of their sense of protection both the environment and do a great deal with spending the least money: Eutrophication and Aquatic Habitat. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p style="color: black"><strong>Eutrophication</strong> is a complex thing. 
			   Whatever, we can define this as a kind like too much of a good thing. 
			   As we all know nutrients are required and benefit for humans activities but if you absorb over equal nutrient you will be unhealthy and easy to sick. 
			   Eutrophication is the same thing. In the water, nutrients like nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus are required for marine’s daily lifes, because of nutrients the ecosystem can be existed forever. 
			   Then, eutrophication, the first thing I would like to talk about eutrophication is its origination. 
			   <em>A large number of lakes in the United States, Europe, and Asia have recently been found to be highly eutrophic.(Eutrophication: an ecological vision) </em>
			   As the sentence we can suspect the answer: eutrophication is anthropogenic, mostly. 
			   According to the survey that is mentioned in the classes of water and environment, scientists do a research with the sliced sediment core to estimate the history of the beneath soil and the circumstance of the eutrophication. 
			   After research, they got the graph below. </p>
			<p style="color: black">Data of lake in Italy that was cored:<img src="http://ww4.sinaimg.cn/mw690/abd1797egw1eak5rxuudbj20k50oa0tk.jpg"/><p>
			<p></p>
            <p style="color: black">From the data, it is obviously that the lack of change from 20,000 to 5,000 years ago indicates that there was no natural eutrophication over many centuries; 
			   the only obvious change in the sediment record occurred around 2,000 years ago, when the Romans built a road near the lake, which testify the speculation front. 
			   In this case another question comes out: which organic or inorganic substance plays the vital role in the water eutrophication? 
			   <strong>Phosphorus is</strong>. 
			   Phosphorus is an important nutrient in water for phytoplankton growing, but as I said forward that things will develop in an opposite direction when they become extreme; 
			   too much phosphorus content in raw sewage which is pumped directly into the lake added over balance phosphorus in it and cause the water eutrophication. Just like what the professional article said <em>Most of the water bodies world over are surrounded with densely populated human settlement areas and agricultural fields. 
			   The size of smaller water bodies in human settlement areas is on the decrease with rise in population. 
			   After treatment, a large quantity of sewage from the households is regularly discharged into the water bodies. 
			   The runoff brings down fertilizers and other chemicals from agricultural fields. 
			   The phosphorus contained in these effluents is known to promote excessive growth of plants. 
			   This review is an account of the role, sources, and monitoring of phosphorus, as well as its cycle. 
			   The natural phosphorus cycle originating from the weathering of phosphate rock is now a two-way operation, due to significant addition of phosphorus from anthropogenic sources (Eutrophication: an ecological vision)</em>.
			   Otherwise, sometimes eutrophication is a inevitable trend. As filtering the chaotic knowleage, one specific water eutrophication as we all know is red tide, a kind of phytoplankton bloom. 
			   <em>Hundreds of dead or injured seabirds have washed up on the shores of Monterey Bay in recent weeks, and scientists believe a red tide of marine algae is to blame.
			   The affected birds include loons, pelicans, western grebes, northern fulmars and surf scoters, said Dave Jessup, a veterinarian with the state Department of Fish and Game. (SAN FRANCISCO (AP)) </em>
			   From the report it is apparent that eutrophication is toxic, it is harmful and negative and this is why people want to find ways to deal with it. 
			   What I consider ironic is mankind always does something bad and harmful to environment and then when this affects their own values and lives then they will pay a large amount of money to prevent it but never thinking why just stop it’s origin. 
			   Actually there is a source of skill for Americans to purification to water, which is divided into four parts: the Preliminary treatment, the Primary treatment, the Secondary treatment and the Tertiary treatment, 
			   but because of the high marginal cost of the Tertiary treatment, most of the raw sewage just ends up at the secondary treatment which is not so good. 
			   Whatever, do you know how they decide to deal with the eutrophication, I mean the rest water after secondary treatment? 
			   From the article, it said <em>In several countries adequate control measures have been adopted in to control eutrophication. 
			   But these measures were found to be only partially effective in controlling the phosphorus unloading in water bodies. 
			   In this review some control measures are suggested, with emphasis on biological control. 
			   The review concludes by taking into account the ecological prospective of the water-the precious fluid and a basis of life on the earth.(Eutrophication: an ecological vision) </em>
			   So, here are two ways one is diverting the raw sewage to the ocean instead of the lake, which is the solution by the government that administer lake Washington, the other way is to reduce the content of phosphorus in articles for daily use like detergent. 
			   Actually, this has the exact opposite relationship with inflation in macroeconomics. Inflation, which means far more things are demand than society supply, which means the price will increase and money will be no more than money but like paper that will spend in an bloodcurdling situation, in practice I think this is not the opposite but the same thing with eutrophication. 
			   Both of them own too much of a substance and need some ways to prevent or administer it. 
			   In my macroeconomic class when I discuss inflation with my professor L. Martin, the best way to control inflation is to control the currency circulation by government and federal laws; 
			   Just like the essay said, <em>The influence is stronger for financial market-based measures and for forecasters’ influence expectations than for measures based on consumer expectations.(Inflation Expectations---Role and Measurement for Monetary Policy)</em>,  
			   inflation control is totally important for the market, which indicates that the best way to control eutrophication is to control the limiting nutrient by exact law or rules or government, which in my mind is a kind of technology to deal with this. 
			   Also, according to the biochemistry, reducing phosphorus also suppress the germination of phytoplankton. 
			   But because of unhappy reasons, people prefer pumping to other places to reducing phosphorus content. 
			   I talked a lot after class with my ISP professor Dr.Peacor about the former solution way. 
			   I asked him if there will be some negative influence to ocean as people continue pouring raw sewage to ocean except ocean red tides or blooms, and I remembered my professor said of course there will have some influence but because ocean is big and some people thinks this will not threat to their lives. 
			   Of course, people are selfish animals. 
			   Also, admittedly, we could not find better ways to solve this problem. 
			   But is it really nice for stalling tactics? No one knows. 
			   But when I asked if all tides in the ocean are anthropogenic, the professor said, definitely not. 
			   In some case red tides is a procedure process in nature as ecosystem wants to keep balance. 
			   And I am glad to see what will happen in the future. 
			   No matter economic or biochemistry, this refract a serious thing. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p style="color: black">The second one I would like to talk about is <strong>the Aquatic Habitat</strong>. 
			   I believe without a shadow of doubt that every creature has its own existing value. 
			   <em>With increased emphasis on environmental quality objectives in water resources planning and management, past practices of simply considering water quality as the only environmental quality objective are inappropriate. 
			   Expanded environmental quality objectives include maintenance of high quality aquatic habitats.( Aquatic Habitat Analysis as an Element of Water Resources Planning and Management) </em>
			   There are diverse aquatic habitats and eight types of them are the most usual: lakes, ponds, rivers, marshes, swamps, sedge meadow and open bogs. 
			   In terms of the Powerpoint about aquatic habitat, the first two types, lakes and ponds, are not so different to others. 
			   The only thing I want to mention about ponds is both ephemeral ponds and permanent ponds are extremely important in ecosystem. Because of the food chain, there are always some species that cannot survive in permanent ponds, in which case the ephemeral one will be the best burrow for them to reproduction. 
			   Also, there is one thing that is related to eutrophication in the lakes: the stratification. 
			   What is stratification? 
			   When lakes have layers like epilimnion, thermocline, hypolimnion, then it is stratified. Just like the graph shown below.</p>
			<p></p>
            <p style="color: black">Vertical temperature zone in the open water:<img src="http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/mw690/abd1797egw1eak5s4y8amj206o06gq2y.jpg"/> </p>
			<p></p>
			<p style="color: black">What’s more, different seasons own different temperature profile. 
			   In spring and fall, it is totally different with in summer and in winter. 
			   <em>The Incremental Methodology uses measures of aquatic habitat to assess in stream flows required by aquatic life. (Aquatic Habitat Analysis as an Element of Water Resources Planning and Management) </em>
			   This sentence indicates the momentous of river and stream in aquatic system. 
			   A River is a permanently flowing body of water contained within a stream channel, and this flowing body produces the fertile floodplain for creatures to live and reproduce. Marshes and swamps are nearly the same, one distinguish is the vegetation. 
			   Marshes have three types of vegetation: emergent plant, float plant and submerge plant, while swamp own trees or shrubs like mangrove forest. 
			   Tenacious vitality is the only characteristic I would like to talk about the Sedge Meadow. 
			   And here comes the last type: the open bog. Wet, nutrient poor, sphagnum moss overlaying peat, bog is just like a mat of sponge. 
			   Bogs receive all or most of their water from precipitation rather than from runoff, groundwater or streams, which is the reason why it owns so low nutrient input. 
			   After knowing each use of the aquatic habitat, it is easy to understand how to utilize these to make our life better or more convenient. 
			   Just like the article said: <em>Methods used to determine in stream flow needs for rivers in Illinois are reviewed, and the use of this information in developing regulations limiting water extraction for off stream use are described. 
			   Aquatic Habitat based management is shown to provide workable methods to meet expanded environmental quality objectives in water resources planning and management. (Author’s abstract) (Aquatic Habitat Analysis as an Element of Water Resources Planning and Management)</em>
               Aquatic habitats are useful things then they are widely used with nobody concerns if there are one day they all disappear, just like people do not think about sewage treatment until there is something bad happened, which also like the sunk cost in macroeconomics. 
			   Sunk cost is a cost that people have to pay or spend in our daily life, for instance when you buy a airplane ticket then the sunk cost will be the fuel charge, whether or not you are going to take this airport you should pay for it. 
			   Many people will consider why sunk cost is required while it makes us so unhappy, but just think like insurance, you maybe feel like it is worthless but for others that is a kind of invest and protection, which promote the currency circulation in market. 
			   So government will do something to protect the sunk cost as well like we should protect aquatic habitat, with different but developed technologies. I asked about another ISP professor: Dr. Sarnelle when he is doing an experiment about acidification. Acidification is indisputable anthropogenic. With the color in flasks turn from blue to yellow, my mind begins to think about the aquatic habitat. Although Lake Erie and Lake Ontario do not affect by acidification, it does not mean other aquatic habitats will not be influenced for there are not all places that have limestone or Ca2+. When I talked about this to professor, he said yes. Undoubtedly, human activities are the chief culprit of acidification, and because of the chain reaction it will damage aquatic habitat as well then it will be affect human themselves. Irony birth out again. Darwin said that survival of the fittest. Admittedly, it is the truth. We live here, compare, strive, laugh and cry. What we do are all for ourselves. So it is venial if we just think about ourselves. But I would like to say if people care more about environment just like they care about sunk cost and take prevention steps earlier, aquatic habitat will last longer.</p>
			<p></p>
            <p style="color: black">Based on what I have mentioned above, it is obvious that water plays an important role in ecosystem in environment. 
			   Then what about its economic and quality of life issues in our daily lives? 
			   Think about this: because of the toxic of algae blooms from eutrophication, people should remove these toxic phytoplankton organics out of the water body, which will be unexpectedly costly and waste labor force. 
			   Also, government never fail to fascinate collecting funds to clean the water body, in which side cause publics to pay more attention and buy more insurance because of flood tramp. 
			   Insurance is a kind of economic intermediation that let people to buy it in order to protect their own property like from economic field it is easy to know that people prefer giving money every month to buy insurance to lose a large amount of money because of accident disasters. 
			   It is a kind of capital market to earn money. 
			   In biochemistry field it is also very difficult to say if dealing with raw sewage is perfect or not and it is hard to find out solutions with any updated technologies. 
			   People still need to find out more new things and develop more new technologies to deal with this otherwise market lets people to spend more money and some others earn more money in the nature system, which is a circulation. 
			   When talking about reducing water pollution and dealing eutophication and preventing aquatic habitat, the representative one person I would like to mention of is Wu Lihong, one of the most famous environmental activist and warrior and the guy who devotes all his life in environment and advocate that there should be no water pumping into the lake while no definitely treatment. 
			   He used his knowledge of biochemistry and economic to reduce unneeded waste of money whereas less pollution into the water. 
			   Just treat everything and every value as yours than you will find something changes. 
               So, what you will learn either in biochemistry or business is how to deal with problems and revolute new ideas and find more materials to solve unsolved questions so far, to help people have a better life.</p>
