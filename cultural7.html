			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>In a word, every country owns its own cult ures, and the most important thing is to keep them shaped what they ought to be but not disappear with the time flying; 
			   also, their existence is a good demonstration of our culture. 
			   And I believe the martial art in China is a very specific example of it. 
			   I believe even though there are still something that are unperfect, these will all be resolved one day. 
			   No pains, no gains. Martial art will one day be the most shiny star in the dark sky.
			   Whatâ€™s more, whatever your culture is, wherever you are, be yourself, tell others about your culture, and make your country more attractive to others. 
			   I think this is another proposal purpose for us to write and analysis our own culture. 
			   Why not do something to our country? 
			   I believe one day you will miss such lives. 
			   Welcome to China, and do you want to try Tai Ji?</p>
