			<h1>Appretiation: the social network</h1>
			<p>Marx is a talent but also he is a loser in his emotion.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Obviously, from the movie we can know that a male who was broken up by his girlfriend made a decision to revenge her, which is the origin of the facebook.
			   But at the end of the movie we also know that Mark refreshed his computer website of Eric again and again and wanted to add his fore-girlfriend as a friend in facebook. 
			   Just like that female said: Mark, you are not.. You are just so consious. I am sorry I did not remembered clearly. But this means he is a nice man, not like a cold-blood animal. He cares many things but just not know how to deal with them perfectly.
			   Like his emotion.</p>
			<p></p>
            <p>At the beginning of the movie, girls played an important role inside. At first it just means Eric, she broke up with Mark and then Mark put her picture and something else to establish a website to let other boys in Harvard University to evaluate and give points to the two pictures of gils.
			   In this case, the network of Harvard even broke. And Mark's girlriend was sad about this. But at last, Mark still felt he also love that girl, and he wanted to add her, also, without her, without facebook.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>So what can we learn is that, girls sometimes are not so intelligent as boys, but they can affect boys to do something crazy and might go to success because of her.</p>
