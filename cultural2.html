			<h1 style="font-family: Garamond; color: yellow">Introduction</h1>
			<p style="color: black">There is always a saying goes like <strong><em>when you in Rome, do as the Romans do</em></strong>. 
			   Then, why they continue saying that without any confusion? 
			   Why should we do the things like Romans when we were in Rome? 
			   What is the origin of this? Obviously, different cultures cause different conventions, which are why diversification appears all over the world, and then there appear cultures.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p style="color: black">Different country has different cultures. 
			   Then, is there one culture that can change your life totally or paint your life into a wonderful drawing? 
			   Is there one culture that can lead to or represent your country’s culture? 
			   Is there any culture that looks so weird or incredible to others and you can always see others’ open mouths when they come to your country? 
			   The culture that I am going to talk about which may be very strange to you is definitely satisfying all questions above: The Martial art. 
			   It is the thing that gives me a lot of memory and imaginations. 
			   Also, wasting a lot of my saliva to introduce and interpret it.</p>
